# Notes

Notes should kept in this directory.


## Asset

Assets related to notes should kept in asset sub directory in every subject directory. Asset should be compressed or optimized to reduce unwanted space.


## Metadata

**title** of a note should contain what the note is about. It should also appear in top of the page with `#` (biggest heading)

**date** should contain `yyyy-mm-dd` format. Use the date the note was delivered to student, not the date of writing it to markdown.

**faculty** must contain full name of faculty.

**prepared_by** should contain the name(s) of student who prepared the note. If more than one, seperate each name with comma. Check [student naming system](#student-naming-system).

**contributed_by** should contain the name(s) of student who wrote the note in markdown and contributed on this repository. If more than one, seperate each name with comma. Check [student naming system](#student-naming-system).


## Student Naming System

Student name should be in short form. Student may write his last 3 digit (as our section range) of his/her ID, or a short name in below table. If a student is contributing for the first time and he/she wants to use his/her short form of name, write your name on below table and include it in pull request.

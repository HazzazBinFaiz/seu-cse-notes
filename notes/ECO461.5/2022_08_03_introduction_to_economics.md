# Introduction to economics

#### Why should an engineering student study economics ?
An engineer may wish to study economics because an understanding of economics will allow the engineer to make better, more well-informed choices in his/her everyday life, wether the choice is about spending various savings or having decided on how to allocate savings between different assets.

1. Fundamentally engineers are builders, designers, and creators, most of whatever they design are to be sold to the public the goods and services are governed by the market (Economy) Therefore sound understanding of how the economy works is crucial for success in engineering life.
2. As an engineer climbs the corporate ladder, there will be greater exposure to managing money and resources. Economics is all about the wise allocation and savings between different assets.
3. Engineering economy provides nigher order thinking similar to engineer discipline (Analyze , Evaluate, create)

##### Scarcity
We can have something but not all the things. Scarcity is shown by the frontier itself.

##### Choice
Choice is charectarized by the available options we have.

##### Oppertunity cost
The best alternative we have forgone while making a choice is called oppertunity cost.

##### Productive efficiency
Productive efficiency is represented by the point (A-E) on the PPF

##### Productive inefficiency
Productive efficiency is represented by the point F on the PPF

##### Unemployed resources
Unemployed resources is represented by the point F on the PPF

##### Economic growth
An increase in resource or advance in technology can increase the production capabilities of an economy, leading to economic growth a shift outward in the PPF.
